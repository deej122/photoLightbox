This application uses the Flickr API to pull the photos from an album I've created on Flickr.
It displays thumbnails of these images on the page and allows the user to click one to view it in a lightbox.
Then, the user can either toggle through the images using the arrow keys or buttons on-screen or close the lightbox using the Escape key, clicking on the black background, or pressing the "Close" button in the top-left corner.

===========

This is a static application.
An AJAX call is made on page load to retrieve the album of photos from Flickr.
Then, native JavaScript is used to dynamically put the page together and achieve all functionality.
Some basic CSS is used to make the page NICE!
